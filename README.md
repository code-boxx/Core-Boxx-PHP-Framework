## CORE BOXX
Core Boxx is an open-source PHP framework that comes with installable PWA, PDO database, pretty URL, JWT sessions, and API out of the box. But the idea is not to be a bloated framework with tons of unused features. It is built with the concept of modularity, loading only what you need – It also has plenty of "predefined system modules" that you can add on later.
<br><br>

## :white_check_mark: "OUT OF THE BOX" FEATURES
1) Modular PHP framework.
2) Pretty URL.
3) API endpoints with CORS support.
4) Installable Progressive Web App.
5) JSON Web Token sessions.
6) Bootstrap HTML template.

## :floppy_disk: INSTALLATION & NOTES
1) Just copy the `core` folder into your HTTP folder. Then access `http://your-site.com/` in the browser and walk through the installer.
2) The rest are optional modules. Too lazy and messy to create separate repos for each...
3) Some optional modules may require "extra installation steps", do check out the documentation - https://code-boxx.com/core-boxx-php-framework/#sec-ref
<br><br>
