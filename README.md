## CORE BOXX
Core Boxx is a PHP framework built with the concept of simplicity and modularity. Install and load only what you need, not bloated with unused features.

TLDR - "Jumpstart your project with a collection of predefined plug-and-play modules".

1) Pretty URL and routing.
2) API endpoints withÂ CORS support.
3) Installable Progressive Web App.
4) JSON Web Token sessions.
5) Bootstrap HTML template.

## :floppy_disk: INSTALLATION & NOTES
1) Just copy `core/` into your project folder. Access `http://your-site.com/` in the browser and walk through the installer.
2) The rest are optional modules... Too lazy and messy to create separate repos for each.
3) Some modules may require "extra installation steps", do check out the respective documentation - https://code-boxx.com/core-boxx-php-framework/#sec-ref
<br><br>
