## CORE BOXX
Core Boxx is a lightweight PHP modular development framework. The whole idea is not to be another bloated framework with tons of unused features. So it is built around the concept of modularity, load only what you need. It is more like “predefined system modules you can expand on”, rather than a full-fledged framework.

## NOTES ON THIS REPO
1) Too lazy to create a repo for every module, so I have combined the core engine and all modules into this one.
2) To get started, you only need to work with the `core` folder - The rest are optional modules.
