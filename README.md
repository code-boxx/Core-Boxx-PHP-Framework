## CORE BOXX
Core Boxx is an open-source PHP framework that comes with an installable PWA, a PDO database, a pretty URL, and an API out of the box. But the idea is not to be a bloated framework with tons of unused features. It is built with the concept of modularity, loading only what you need – It also has plenty of “predefined system modules” that you can add on later.
<br><br>

## "OUT OF THE BOX" FEATURES
1) Modular PHP framework.
2) Pretty URL.
3) API endpoints with CORS support.
4) Progressive web app.
5) Bootstrap HTML template.

## NOTES ON THIS REPO
1) Too lazy to create a repo for every module, so I have combined the core engine and all modules into this one.
2) To get started, you only need to work with the `core` folder - The rest are optional modules.
